Errors were:
	Parsing
		- In "ReadFile.c" in ReadMap() - E01:
		The Textures struct isnt freed if any quitting error is caused, i.e. an E_-Function
		is called, as the struct is not passed in the Function and therefore can not yet be freed, causing leaks

		- In "ReadFile_Helpers2.c" in extractRGBs() - E02:
		The Digits of the RGB values arent properly parsed. If a Number is too long its passed in groups of
		3 digits and combined to a Number. For example 255255255,0,0 is passed as [255][255][255]
